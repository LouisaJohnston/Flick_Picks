# Project 2

Your pitch readme should have the following:
a Description of the app


mvp goals
stretch goals
user stories
explanation of the APIs you plan to use
daily sprints
wireframes
database ERDs
a RESTful routing chart for your app
MVP Goals

A concise list of feature goals you will need to attain to have a Minimum Viable Product.
Stretch Goals

Extra features you would like to implement after you have a solid MVP.
User Stories

Short, simple descriptions of how a feature will be used from a user's perspective. They are written in an informal, natural language, from a userâ€™s perspective, and help your development stay focused on a good user experience.
Use this handy template for writing user stories: As a user, I want to [be able to perform and action/do something] so that [I get some form of value or benefit]
Write a user story for each feature you need to implement in your app.
Daily Sprints

Plan out your daily goals in advance so you can keep on track with MVP!

Exapmle of Daily Sprints

Monday:
test API
wireframe app
plan database ERD
plan routes
Tuesday:
create db models -- test db
stub routes -- test routes
build routes
Wednesday:
finish routes
create views
Thursday:
finish views
mvp
Friday:
debug refactor
style views
Saturday:
style views
stretch goals
Sunday:
stretch goals
Wireframes

Use a tool like https://awwapp.com/, https://www.mockflow.com/, or good ol zoom whiteboard to create wireframes for your project. Whatever you use, get a screen cap.
Your wireframes should walk the reader through the screen states, and should include short descriptions of each screen. It's a good idea to give your wireframes labels (like 1, 2, 3 etc), and to indicate which screens transitions to which other screens.
Move your image files into the project folder and link them in your README. (You might want to put all your wireframe images into a single folder called images or assets. In that case you'll have to specify the filepath to those images including the containing folder.) Pro tip: use VScode's markdown previewer!
ERDs

you can use dbdesigner.net or a similar tool plan your database schema. Screengrabs are the quickest way to get your ERDs into your readme!
RESTful routing chart

Can be a table in your readme.md or another spreadsheet. Plan out your routes that go along with the views you wireframed.
include all the routes your app will need!
